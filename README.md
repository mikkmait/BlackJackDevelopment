# BlackJackDevelopment
Simple BlackJack game development for javascript/css learning purposes.

This is a development process for a javascript course

VERSION 1 (current)

OBJECTIVES

1) Create a deck of cards.

2) Get random 4 cards from that deck.

3) After dealing reveal those cards to the user.
  3.1) Added objective during process - also while revealing assign a color style to the cards based on suit.

4) Hide the cards before dealing new ones, so the dealing would be blind for the user.

5) End the game when the deck runs out out of cards.
  5.1) Added alert funcionality for other situations as well (trying to deal when cards are revealed)
  5.2) Made button and cards coordinated with bordercolor so it would be seen what button needs to be pushed.

6) Use javascript and css to apply different styling for the various stages of the game.

All objectives accomplished with minor bugs.

FUTURE VERSION PLANS

1) Responsiveness for phone

2) More Blackjack functions (like hit and stay, and also hide one of the dealers cards until players hand is confirmed.
